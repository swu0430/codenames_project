# Codenames Project

A fun personal project (still under development) to learn how to create a Flutter web application. The goal is to create an online version of the Codenames board game that allows for 3 gameplay versions: words, pictures, and word & pictures. 

A work-in-progress version of the game can be found here: https://detective-dingo.web.app/
